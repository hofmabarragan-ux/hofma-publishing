			<h1>About Hofma Publishing</h1>
			<div class="about-body">
				<p>
					Hofma Publishing is basically just me, Niels. It started as a hobby because I love the process of creating books—from doing the research to sitting with the layout. Today, I use this platform to share my projects with anyone who might find them interesting.
				</p>
				<p>
					I publish through Amazon KDP to ensure my books can reach readers everywhere, whether you prefer holding a physical copy or reading on your Kindle.
				</p>
				<p>
					For me, every book is a passion project. Whether it's a detailed guide to Europe or a new story, my goal is simply to create something that inspires, entertains, or informs. Thank you for supporting my work and being part of this journey.
